# Applied AI Lab  
**Where AI gets practical.**

We build and explore at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Data**, and **Software Engineering** — from Quality Assurance and automation to development tools, reliability systems, and intelligent infrastructure.

Our mission is to turn AI concepts into usable, measurable engineering solutions.  
We take a **data-driven approach** — experimenting, prototyping, and open-sourcing tools that make AI more accessible, explainable, and effective in real-world workflows.

## Focus Areas
- **Applied AI for testing, quality, and validation**  
- **Intelligent automation in CI/CD and DevOps**  
- **Data-driven decision systems and analysis**  
- **AI-assisted code analysis and generation**  
- **Reliability and observability through machine learning**

Every project here is an experiment in making software smarter, faster, and more dependable — without losing the craftsmanship of good engineering.
